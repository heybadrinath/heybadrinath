# Hey, I'm Badri!  

### 🛠️ Backend & Full-Stack Dev | HealthTech Innovator

Welcome to my digital garage — where APIs run smooth, AI models stay hydrated, and systems scale like gym bros on pre-workout.

### About Me

- **Backend Enthusiast** crafting scalable systems with **Node.js**, **Express**, **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and **microservices** that just *vibe* right.
- **AI/ML explorer** building intelligent stuff — from **health prediction** to **smart recommendations** and **digital twins** for real-world humans.
- Making **MERN apps** that *correct your grammar* and whisper *constructive feedback* in your ear like a polite ghost.
- Creating real-time systems that actually *do things*, like accident prediction using sensors and LLMs.  
- On a mission to **optimize everything** — yes, even the way my toast pops out of the toaster.
